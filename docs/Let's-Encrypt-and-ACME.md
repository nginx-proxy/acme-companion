## Let's Encrypt / ACME

**NOTE on CAA**: Please ensure that your DNS provider answers correctly to CAA record requests. [If your DNS provider answer with an error, Let's Encrypt won't issue a certificate for your domain](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/caa/). Let's Encrypt do not require that you set a CAA record on your domain, just that your DNS provider answers correctly.

**NOTE on IPv6**: If the domain or sub domain you want to issue certificate for has an AAAA record set, Let's Encrypt will favor challenge validation over IPv6. [There is an IPv6 to IPv4 fallback in place but Let's Encrypt can't guarantee it'll work in every possible case](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder/issues/2770#issuecomment-340489871), so bottom line is **if you are not sure of both your host and your host's Docker reachability over IPv6, do not advertise an AAAA record** or LE challenge validation might fail.

As described on [basic usage](./Basic-usage.md), the `LETSENCRYPT_HOST` environment variables needs to be declared in each to-be-proxied application containers for which you want to enable SSL and create certificate. It most likely needs to be the same as the `VIRTUAL_HOST` variable and must resolve to your host (which has to be publicly reachable).

The following environment variables are optional and parametrize the way the Let's Encrypt client works.

### per proxyed container

#### DNS-01 ACME challenge

In order to switch to the DNS-01 ACME challenge, set the `ACME_CHALLENGE` environment variable to `DNS-01` on your acme-companion container. This will also require you to set the `ACMESH_DNS_API_CONFIG` environment variable to a JSON or YAML string containing the configuration for the DNS provider you are using. Inside the JSON or YAML string, the `DNS_API` property is always required and should be set to the name of the [acme.sh DNS API](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/tree/3.0.9/dnsapi) you want to use.

The other properties required will depend on the DNS provider you are using. For more information on the required properties for each DNS provider, please refer to the [acme.sh documentation](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/dnsapi) (please keep in mind that nginxproxy/acme-companion is using a fixed version of acme.sh, so the documentation might include DNS providers that are not yet available in the version used by this image).

Both `ACME_CHALLENGE` and `ACMESH_DNS_API_CONFIG` environment variables can also be set on the proxied application container, in which case they will override the values set on the acme-companion container, if any.

Not: if you do not plan on using the `HTTP-01` challenge at all, you won't need to share `/usr/share/nginx/html` between the **nginx-proxy** and **acme-companion** containers, and can remove this volume from both.

Example using [Cloudflare DNS](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/blob/master/dnsapi/dns_cf.sh):
```console
docker run --detach \
    --name nginx-proxy-acme \
    --volume certs:/etc/nginx/certs \
    --volume acme:/etc/acme.sh \
    --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
    --env "DEFAULT_EMAIL=mail@yourdomain.tld" \
    --env "ACME_CHALLENGE=DNS-01" \
    --env "ACMESH_DNS_API_CONFIG={'DNS_API': 'dns_cf', 'CF_Key': 'yourCloudflareApiKey', 'CF_Email': 'yourCloudflareAccountEmail'}" \
    nginxproxy/acme-companion
```

Same example on a Docker compose file:
```yaml
services:
  # nginx proxy container omitted
    
  acme:
    image: nginxproxy/acme-companion
    container_name: nginx-proxy-acme
    volumes:
      - certs:/etc/nginx/certs
      - acme:/etc/acme.sh
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
    environment:
      DEFAULT_EMAIL: mail@yourdomain.tld
      ACME_CHALLENGE: DNS-01
      ACMESH_DNS_API_CONFIG: |-
        DNS_API: dns_cf
        CF_Key: yourCloudflareApiKey
        CF_Email: yourCloudflareAccountEmail
    
    # app container omitted

volumes:
  certs:
  acme:
```

If you experience issues with the DNS-01 ACME challenge, please try to get it working outside of the container before opening an issue. If you can't get it working outside of the container, please seek support on the [acme.sh repository](https://github.com/acmesh-official).

#### Multi-domains certificates

Specify multiple hosts with a comma delimiter to create multi-domains ([SAN](https://www.digicert.com/subject-alternative-name.htm)) certificates (the first domain in the list will be the base domain).

Example:

```shell
$ docker run --detach \
    --name your-proxyed-app \
    --env "VIRTUAL_HOST=yourdomain.tld,www.yourdomain.tld,anotherdomain.tld" \
    --env "LETSENCRYPT_HOST=yourdomain.tld,www.yourdomain.tld,anotherdomain.tld" \
    nginx
```

Let's Encrypt has a limit of [100 domains per certificate](https://letsencrypt.org/fr/docs/rate-limits/), while Buypass limit is [15 domains per certificate](https://www.buypass.com/ssl/products/go-ssl-campaign).

#### Separate certificate for each domain

The example above will issue a single domain certificate for all the domains listed in the `LETSENCRYPT_HOST` environment variable. If you need to have a separate certificate for each of the domains, you can add set the `LETSENCRYPT_SINGLE_DOMAIN_CERTS` environment variable to `true`.

Example:

```shell
$ docker run --detach \
    --name your-proxyed-app \
    --env "VIRTUAL_HOST=yourdomain.tld,www.yourdomain.tld,anotherdomain.tld" \
    --env "LETSENCRYPT_HOST=yourdomain.tld,www.yourdomain.tld,anotherdomain.tld" \
    --env "LETSENCRYPT_SINGLE_DOMAIN_CERTS=true" \
    nginx
```

#### Automatic certificate renewal
Every hour (3600 seconds) the certificates are checked and per default every certificate that have been issued at least [60 days](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/blob/f2d350002e7c387fad9777a42cf9befe34996c35/acme.sh#L61) ago is renewed. For Let's Encrypt certificates, that mean they will be renewed 30 days before expiration.

#### Contact address

The `LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL` environment variable must be a valid email and will be used by Let's Encrypt to warn you of impeding certificate expiration (should the automated renewal fail) and to recover an account.

#### Private key size

The `LETSENCRYPT_KEYSIZE` environment variable determines the type and size of the requested key. Supported values are `2048`, `3072` and `4096` for RSA keys, and `ec-256` or `ec-384` for elliptic curve keys. The default is RSA 4096.  
To change the global default set the `DEFAULT_KEY_SIZE` environment variable on the **acme-companion** container to one of the supported values specified above.

#### OCSP stapling

The `ACME_OCSP` environment variable, when set to `true` on a proxied application container, will add the [OCSP Must-Staple extension](https://blog.apnic.net/2019/01/15/is-the-web-ready-for-ocsp-must-staple/) to the issued certificate. Please read about OCSP Must-Staple support in Nginx if you intend to use this feature (https://trac.nginx.org/nginx/ticket/812 and https://trac.nginx.org/nginx/ticket/1830)

#### Test certificates

The `LETSENCRYPT_TEST` environment variable, when set to `true` on a proxied application container, will create a test certificates that don't have the [5 certs/week/domain limits](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/) and are signed by an untrusted intermediate (they won't be trusted by browsers).

If you want to do this globally for all containers, set `ACME_CA_URI` on the **acme-companion** container as described in [Container configuration](./Container-configuration.md).

#### ACME CA URI

The `ACME_CA_URI` environment variable is used to set the ACME API endpoint from which the container's certificate(s) will be requested (defaults to ``https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory``).

#### Preferred chain

If the ACME CA provides multiple cert chain, you can use the `ACME_PREFERRED_CHAIN` environment variable to select one. See [`acme.sh --preferred-chain` documentation](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/Preferred-Chain) for more info.

#### Container restart on cert renewal

The `LETSENCRYPT_RESTART_CONTAINER` environment variable, when set to `true` on an application container, will restart this container whenever the corresponding cert (`LETSENCRYPT_HOST`) is renewed. This is useful when certificates are directly used inside a container for other purposes than HTTPS (e.g. an FTPS server), to make sure those containers always use an up to date certificate.

#### Pre-Hook and Post-Hook

The `ACME_PRE_HOOK` and `ACME_POST_HOOK` let you use the [`acme.sh` Pre- and Post-Hooks feature](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/Using-pre-hook-post-hook-renew-hook-reloadcmd) to run commands respectively before and after the container's certificate has been issued. For more information see [Pre- and Post-Hook](./Hooks.md)


### global (set on acme-companion container)

#### Default contact address

The `DEFAULT_EMAIL` variable must be a valid email and, when set on the **acme-companion** container, will be used as a fallback when no email address is provided using proxyed container's `LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL` environment variables. It is highly recommended to set this variable to a valid email address that you own.

#### Private key re-utilization

The `RENEW_PRIVATE_KEYS` environment variable, when set to `false` on the **acme-companion** container, will set `acme.sh` to reuse previously generated private key instead of generating a new one at renewal for all domains.

Reusing private keys can help if you intend to use [HPKP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Public_Key_Pinning), but please note that HPKP has been deprecated by Google's Chrome and that it is therefore strongly discouraged to use it at all.

#### ACME accounts handling

- Use one `acme.sh` configuration directory (`--config-home`) per account email address.
- Each `acme.sh` configuration directory can hold several accounts on different ACME service providers. But only one per service provider.
- The `default` configuration directory holds the configuration for empty account email address.
- When in testing mode (`LETSENCRYPT_TEST=true`):
    1. The container will use the special purpose `staging` configuration directory.
    1. The directory URI is forced to The Let's Encrypt v2 staging one (`ACME_CA_URI` is ignored)
    2. The account email address is forced empty (`DEFAULT_EMAIL` and `LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL` are ignored)

#### Self signed default certificate

If you want **acme-companio** to create a self signed certificate as default certificate for **nginx-proxy**, you can set the `CREATE_DEFAULT_CERTIFICATE` environment variable to `true`. This will generate a self signed cert / key pair to `/etc/nginx/certs/default.crt` and `/etc/nginx/certs/default.key`, with `acme-companion` as Common Name. Please note that no future support is planned for this feature and it might be removed in a future release.
