## Optional container environment variables for custom configuration.

* `ACME_CA_URI` - Directory URI for the CA ACME API endpoint (defaults to ``https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory``).

If you set this environment variable value to `https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory` the container will obtain its certificates from Let's Encrypt test API endpoint that don't have the [5 certs/week/domain limit](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/) (but are not trusted by browsers).

For example

```bash
$ docker run --detach \
    --name nginx-proxy-acme \
    --volumes-from nginx-proxy \
    --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
    --volume certs:/etc/nginx/certs:rw \
    --volume acme:/etc/acme.sh \
    --env "ACME_CA_URI=https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory" \
    nginxproxy/acme-companion
```
You can also create test certificates per container (see [Test certificates](./Let's-Encrypt-and-ACME.md#test-certificates))

* `DEBUG` - Set it to `1` to enable debugging of the entrypoint script and generation of LetsEncrypt certificates, which could help you pin point any configuration issues.

* `RENEW_PRIVATE_KEYS` - Set it to `false` to make `acme.sh` reuse previously generated private key for each certificate instead of creating a new one on certificate renewal. Reusing private keys can help if you intend to use [HPKP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Public_Key_Pinning), but please note that HPKP has been deprecated by Google's Chrome and that it is therefore strongly discouraged to use it at all.

* `DHPARAM_BITS` - Change the key size of the RFC7919 Diffie-Hellman group used by the container from the default value of 4096 bits. Supported values are `2048`, `3072` and `4096`. The DH group file will be located in the container at `/etc/nginx/certs/dhparam.pem`. Mounting a different `dhparam.pem` file at that location will override the RFC7919 group creation by the acme-companion container. **COMPATIBILITY WARNING**: some older clients (like Java 6 and 7) do not support DH keys with over 1024 bits. In order to support these clients, you must provide your own `dhparam.pem`.

* `DHPARAM_SKIP` - Set it to `true` to disable the Diffie-Hellman group creation by the container entirely.

* `CA_BUNDLE` - This is a test only variable [for use with Pebble](https://github.com/letsencrypt/pebble#avoiding-client-https-errors). It changes the trusted root CA used by `acme.sh`, from the default Alpine trust store to the CA bundle file located at the provided path (inside the container). Do **not** use it in production unless you are running your own ACME CA.

* `CERTS_UPDATE_INTERVAL` - 3600 seconds by default, this defines how often the container will check if the certificates require update.

* `ACME_PRE_HOOK` - The provided command will be run before every certificate issuance. The action is limited to the commands available inside the **acme-companion** container. For example `--env "ACME_PRE_HOOK=echo 'start'"`. For more information see [Pre- and Post-Hook](./Hooks.md)

* `ACME_POST_HOOK` - The provided command will be run after every certificate issuance. The action is limited to the commands available inside the **acme-companion** container. For example `--env "ACME_POST_HOOK=echo 'end'"`. For more information see [Pre- and Post-Hook](./Hooks.md)

## Optional docker host configuration
* `DOCKER_HOST` - set the host for docker. Must include the scheme (`unix://`, `http://` or `https://`)

If the docker host daemon socket is [protected](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/https/):

* `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY` - set it to value `1` if the docker host requires client TLS authentication
* `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` - path to TLS client certificates for the docker host. This folder should contain `cert.pem`, `key.pem` and `ca.pem` files. See [Create a CA, server and client keys with OpenSSL](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/https/#create-a-ca-server-and-client-keys-with-openssl)
